# Event Booking System (Test Task)

This repository contains a simple Event Booking System implemented in C#, designed as a self-assigned practical test task to evaluate my skills in object-oriented programming, class design, and data management using C#. The task was generated by ChatGPT using the prompt: ‚ÄúCreate a realistic task for testing my OOP skills in C#.‚Äù

## üìå Task Description

This is a small, realistic coding exercise designed to simulate an online booking system for various events such as concerts, theater performances, etc.

The system includes the following main classes:

- **Event**: Represents an event.
- **Ticket**: Represents a ticket for a specific event.
- **Customer**: Represents a customer who purchases tickets.
- **BookingService**: Manages event creation, ticket bookings, and displays event information.

## üóÇÔ∏è Requirements

### 1. Class: Event

**Properties:**
- Event name
- Event date
- Venue
- Maximum number of seats
- List of booked tickets

**Methods:**
- Check available seats (`CheckAvailability`)
- Create ticket (`CreateTicket`)

### 2. Class: Ticket

**Properties:**
- Unique ticket ID
- Linked event
- Linked customer

### 3. Class: Customer

**Properties:**
- Customer name
- Email

### 4. Class: BookingService

**Methods:**
- Add a new event (`AddEvent`)
- Book a ticket (`BookTicket`)
- Display event information including seat availability (`ShowEventsInfo`)

## üß© Example Implementation

Example usage (implemented in `Program.cs`):

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Initialize booking service
        BookingService service = new BookingService();

        // Add events
        service.AddEvent(new Event("Rock Concert", new DateTime(2025, 5, 10), "Club A2", 2));
        service.AddEvent(new Event("The Nutcracker Ballet", new DateTime(2025, 12, 15), "Mariinsky Theater", 5));

        // Create customers
        Customer anna = new Customer("Anna Ivanova", "anna@mail.com");
        Customer ivan = new Customer("Ivan Petrov", "ivan@mail.com");
        Customer kate = new Customer("Ekaterina Sidorova", "kate@mail.com");

        // Book tickets
        service.BookTicket("Rock Concert", anna);
        service.BookTicket("Rock Concert", ivan);

        // Attempt to book a ticket when no seats are available
        service.BookTicket("Rock Concert", kate);

        // Show event information
        service.ShowEventsInfo();
    }
}
```

### üî∏ Expected Console Output:

```
Ticket successfully booked for Anna Ivanova to event Rock Concert
Ticket successfully booked for Ivan Petrov to event Rock Concert
Booking failed: No available seats for Rock Concert.

Events information:
- Rock Concert | 10.05.2025 | Club A2 | Available seats: 0 of 2
- The Nutcracker Ballet | 15.12.2025 | Mariinsky Theater | Available seats: 5 of 5
```

## üö© Purpose of This Task

By completing this task, I aim to demonstrate and evaluate my ability to:
- Design interconnected classes.
- Manage object states effectively.
- Implement basic business logic (such as seat availability checks).
- Structure and manage application data clearly.

This project is intended solely as a self-assessment task to improve and verify my programming skills, specifically with classes and object-oriented design in C#.

## üéØ How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open it in your IDE or run via terminal.
3. Use the command `dotnet run` in the project folder to execute the application.
